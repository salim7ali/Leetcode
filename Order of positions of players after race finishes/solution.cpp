// Given an array A, where A[i] = j denotes the fact that player j finished the race before player i, and for the winner of race let's  say player k, A[k]=-1.  
// You need to print the order of the positions of players after race finishes

// Follow up: What if the data (array A) got courrupted, how will you take care of that. Return  -1 if there data is courrupted and order of player otherwise.
